# Dataset
Dataset for IRGen


## dataset structure

1. the source code is in the dir ProgramData_compile/ and ProgramData/, the former one is compilable and the later one is the original txt files
2. dataset_config_poj and dataset_config1 stores the embeddding vectors of the IR file, you can just use it without any training
3. ir_origin/ is the dir where all the LLVM-IR files are. You can just use them to train the optimal sequences if you want
